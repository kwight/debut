=== Debut ===

[Debut](https://github.com/kwight/debut/) is a solid and clean responsive theme, for sharing your ideas with the world. Make Debut your own by changing the background, colors and more with the new Theme Customizer and real-time preview. Based on _s by Automattic, Debut is translation-ready (French is already included), supports featured images, has five widget areas and includes a sliding menu for mobile screens. Debut also includes a full-width page template.

== Instructions ==

Make sure to create and set a menu under Appearance > Menus. Once you've made your menu, select it under Theme Locations > Primary Menu (this is necessary for the sub-menu indicators to appear).

Any default widgets in widget areas can be removed or replaced by simply adding your own widgets.

== Limitations ==

CSS3 Media Queries do not work in IE8 or below.
